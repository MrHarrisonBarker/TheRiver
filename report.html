                <p>
                    I have chosen to create a site around a personal hobby and passion which is the world and community
                    of poker specifically "Texas Hold'em" where members of the community and go to find out about their
                    favorite players, the latest poker news, learn how to play the game and use site tools to better
                    their playing experience.

                        of my sites layout and feel is inspired by not only the washington post’s site but most
                        traditional newspapers sites as they all share a collective “theme” which provide a high level
                        of readability as their derived from traditional paper news.

                        <a href="https://uk.pokernews.com/"><b>PokerNews</b></a> - is a news site dedicated to poker

                        sites design greatly as I’ve tried to produce a layout and colour palette which has the least
                        amount of clutter and unnecessary features.

                    <li>
                        <b>Alt text</b> - Alt tags provide a text description for an image, this allows for search
                        engines to use these descriptions for finding images inside websites. Alt tags can also make a
                        site more accessible by allowing visually impaired users to understand the site.

                    <li>
                        <b>Clear design</b> - By having a clear and concise design a multitude of users will be able to
                        navigate and understand the site with ease therefore increasing accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Defined and obvious colour palette</b> - By integrating the colour scheme with the
                        functionality of
                        the site users can easily and quickly see what an object's purpose is. Having a reduced colour
                        palette will increase accessibility as the contrast between the colours can be greater and more
                        defined with less more contrasting colours.

                    <li>
                        <b>Responsiveness</b> - By having a fully responsive site users can use it on whatever device
                        they
                        want and get the same level of experience on all of them. This makes my site extremely usable.

                    <li>
                        <b>Clear and easy navigation</b> - To make my site more usable I’ve implemented a nav bar
                            which show what state the site in using colour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Legibility</b> - As my site has taken inspiration from traditionally newspapers readability
                        and
                        legibility have been key design focuses, to achieve this I’ve chosen a font which is clear and
                        easy on the eye and to read. I’ve also tried to keep this type clearly spaced from one another
                        whilst also containing it.

                        players and news pages I used templates to create html which where then added to the page based
                        on an external JSON file. To do this I had to reference the handlebars js <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">website</a>
                        to learn how to create templates and how to iterate the template based on an array using the
                        “{{each}}” and “{{if}}” command.

                        in context. I used this reference to create the layout for the site using bootstrap elements
                        and the 12 column grid system which allows for responsive design.

                        <b>Design & Responsiveness</b> -
                        I believe that the design of my site is extremely readable as it draws a lot from traditional
                        printed newspapers this provides a very pleasant user experience and delivers information in
                        clear and concise manner.
                        <br>
                        I also believe that a key focus and execution of a responsive layout allows the user to easily
                        read and understand the content of the site on whatever device it is displayed on. This was
                        achieved through the use of the bootstrap grid system which is completely designed around being
                        responsive.

                    <li>
                        <b>Theming & colour palette</b> -
                        My site features two different colour sets or themes: a light and dark. By having two different
                        ways of viewing the site the user gets to choose the way they experience and read the site
                        based on their preference.
                        <br>
                        By using a reduced colour pallette my site is clear and not overly distracting, i've used
                        colour to point the users attention towards areas of importance and to navigate them through
                        the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Templating</b> - Effective use of templating - I’ve used templating in my site whenever
                        repetitive HTML occurs to make a more pleasant development and maintenance of my site as I only
                        have to mantine one piece of HTML instead of the same but with different data.

                    <li>
                        <b>Extra pages</b> - I would have liked to included a tournaments page which would talk about
                        the current and upcoming tournaments, who's playing, prizes and possibly odds based on number
                        of previous wins.

                    <li>
                        <b>Extra tools</b> -
                        I would have liked to create more tools for the site, one in particular would be an hand rank
                        app which would take your current cards and community cards and calculate the rank of your
                        current hand.
                        <br>
                        Another would be an odds counter which would calculate your chances of winning the current hand
                        based on your cards and the community cards.

                    <li>
                        <b>Design cohesion</b> - I don’t think that all the pages follow the same design pattern
                        completely, especially the links page as it doesn't quite fit the design of the site. I also
                        think that the home page is lacking in content and could have more to captivate the user.
