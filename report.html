                    I have chosen to create a site around a personal hobby and passion which is the world and community
                    of poker specifically "Texas Hold'em" where members of the community and go to find out about their
                    favorite players, the latest poker news, learn how to play the game and use site tools to better
                    their playing experience.

                        traditional newspapers sites as they all share a collective “theme” which provide a high level
                        of readability as their derived from traditional paper news.

                        <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/"><b>Handlebars js templating</b></a> - For the learn,
                        players and news pages I used templates to create html which where then added to the page based
                        on an external JSON file. To do this I had to reference the handlebars js <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">website</a>
                        to learn how to create templates and how to iterate the template based on an array using the
                        “{{each}}” and “{{if}}” command.

                        in context. I used this reference to create the layout for the site using bootstrap elements
                        and the 12 column grid system which allows for responsive design.

                        <b>Design & Responsiveness</b> -
                        I believe that the design of my site is extremely readable as it draws a lot from traditional
                        printed newspapers this provides a very pleasant user experience and delivers information in
                        clear and concise manner.
                        <br>
                        I also believe that a key focus and execution of a responsive layout allows the user to easily
                        read and understand the content of the site on whatever device it is displayed on. This was
                        achieved through the use of the bootstrap grid system which is completely designed around being
                        responsive.

                        <b>Theming & colour palette</b> -
                        My site features two different colour sets or themes: a light and dark. By having two different
                        ways of viewing the site the user gets to choose the way they experience and read the site
                        based on their preference.
                        <br>
                        By using a reduced colour pallette my site is clear and not overly distracting, i've used
                        colour to point the users attention towards areas of importance and to navigate them through
                        the site.

                        I would have liked to create more tools for the site, one in particular would be an hand rank app which would take your current cards and community cards and calculate the rank of your current hand.
                        <br>
                        Another would be an odds counter which would calculate your chances of winning the current hand based on your cards and the community cards.
